      <h2>Day 1</h2>
      <p>We slept outside of the valley at a friends apartment in El Portal. We woke at 430am and almost burnt the
      place down trying to make coffee (turns out the kettle we used was an electric kettles that looked just like a real kettle but
       with a plastic bottom, oops). Despite the rough start we parked the car in the backpackers lot and made it up
       the steep 2k elevation gain to Little Yosemite Valley pretty quickly. Leaving before the sun was up made the
       hard climb more bearable. Vernal and Nevada were amazing.</p>
      <img src="yosemite valley"/>
    </div>
    <div>

    <div>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We were so exhausted from waking up early, adjusting to the elevation and the hard morning climb that we
      ended up taking a lunch time nap in a burnt out part of the forest. This was second nature for John the Hot Shot
      fire fighter but it left us both looking like we had been on the trail much longer than one day.</p>
      <p>The bill of John's hat had "STOKED" written on it really big which encouraged a lot of people to stop and talk
      to us whic was great because we found out that our intended destination Sunrise Meadows was full of misquitos.
      So we decided to stay on a bluff near a stream before the final part of the climb into the meadow. We heard
      Clouds Rest is a great place to stop especially if you are doing a trip from Tolumne to the Valley but it
      was too far out of our way on this trip. Weather was perfect all day. </p>
      <img src="first night camp site"/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <p>Sunrise Meadow was beautiful but we had to almost run through it because the mosquitos were so bad. I felt bad
      for the people staying at the High Sierra camp.</p>
      <img src="sunrise meadow"/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We ate lunch overlooking a giant granite valley. Where we made some friends with Martin and Adele from the
      Czech Republic. Martin is the CTO of Social Bakers a social analytics company where Adele also works. We were
      honored to be the first people to find out of their new engagement which happened just days before. They had just
      finished doing the JMT from Whitney to Tolumne and were now going from Yosemite Valley to Lake Tahoe.</p>
      <img src="john stoked"/>
      <img src="catedral pass selfie"/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Cathedral Lake was spectacular. After enough people calling John "Stoked" it's clear this is his new trail
      name.</p>
      <img src="cathedral lake"/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We made it to Tolumne Meadows despite being confused by the signs which made us think it was at first closer,
      than later farther then we thought. The store ended up being about 1.5 miles from the parking lot with the sign
      that says 3.5 miles to the High Sierra camp. The grill closed at 5pm but the store was open until 8pm so we were
      able to get some beers and sausages to cook on the fire at the Backpackers camp. This would also have been a
      great place to resupply had we planned that out ahead of time.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 3</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Jumped in the Lyle River on our way to Donahue Pass.</p>
      <img src="donahue pass with larz"></img>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We camped near the top of the Donahue Pass next to glacier lakes and water falls. Our site overlooked the
      valley and Lyle River below. Sunset was amazing and there were tons of stars out at night. I think this was the
      best campsite I've ever had.</p>
      <p>This is also where we met Larz and Steph a couple who we ended up hiking with most of the rest of the
      trail.</p>

      <br>
      <br>

    <div>
      <p>Dogs are allowed on the trail from Reds Meadows up to Thousand Island Lakes.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="thousand island lake">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We found a perfect campsite on the north shore of Garnette lake under a leaning tree between the lake and the
      trail. We ate lunch and took a nap here.</p>
      <img src="garnett lake">

      <br>

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Hiked with our new friends Larz and Steph down to shadow lake where they stopped. There were too many
      mosquitos there for us so we decided to try Rosalie lake which was up on top of some switch backs.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Caught and ate our first trout at Rosalie Lake at a fishing spot John used to fish at with his Dad when he was a
      kid. We heard a bear harass every other campsite around the lake except for ours that night. Perhaps because ours
      was more in the open and harder for the bear to sneak into than the others.</p>
      <img src="rosalie camp site">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 5</h2>
      <p>I had my first blister pop on the hike down to Reds Meadow which made it a pretty painful trek.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Devils Postpile was cool. It's fascinating to think about how the rocks formed those unique symetrical curved
      square rods. The store at Reds Meadows has beer and is open until 7pm.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 6</h2>
      <p>We decided to take a "Zero Day" (trail slang for taking the day off) so that we could get some new supplies in
      Mammoth. The tram ride up from Reds Meadows cost $7 and takes about 45 minutes. In town I got a new pack (the
      Osprey 60L to replace the old external frame I was using that was starting to fall apart (John thought Brokepack
      Mountain was a pretty funny trail name for me, I eventually earned a better one). While in Mammoth we were able
      to catch the European Soccer Champship game, Portugal won. </p>
      <img src="osprey pack"><a>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014EBRG5M/ref=twister_B019UTLLEK?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1</a>
      <p>That night we had a big fire at the backpacking camp where we encoutered our first "Trail Troll" (a term John
      came up with). a guy by the name of "Mover" who didn't seem like he moved very far. From what we could gather he
      just hung out the various backpacking camp living off what he could find in the hiker boxes and whatever weed he
      could sell to backpacker passing through. He said he had been "hiking" the PCT and the AT for the last 3
      years.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 7</h2>
      <p>The trail out of Reds Meadows didn't have the best views but was a great hiking trail. It was uphill, which I
      greatly prefer to downhill because its easier on my joints and I get a good workout; dirt, which is so much
      better than rock; and had ample shade. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>There is every color wildflower imaginable along the trail.</p>
      <img src="wildflower pic?">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We took a break at Purple lake with Larz and Steph and our new friends Jeff and Dan. Jeff went to high school
      with John and we randomly ran into him camping next to us at Reds Meadows. Jeff's trail name is "Chef" because he
      brought the most delicious dehydrated dinners which he made himself. I think he got the recipes from this site:
      http://www.theyummylife.com/Instant_Meals_On_The_Go The Apricot Macadmia Nut Chicken Cous Cous was amazing. </p>
      <p>I went for a swim in the lake and Larz caught a fish.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We camped at Virgina lake which is one of the most picturesque lakes I've ever seen. The way sunset lit up the
      mountains around the lake was incredible. It started to get cold when the sun goes down since were up above 11k
      feet now.</p>

      <h2>Day 8</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      We ate lunch on top of Silver Pass with the whole gang. The views were gorgeous.

      <img src="pass 1">

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We took the "ferry", a small 5 person metal fishing boat with a 9 hp outboard motor. To Vermillion Valley
      Resort. Here we picked up our resupply boxes we had sent ourselves, took a shower and got some more beer. John
      lost his removable tooth which he finally found after raking the entire campsite for 5 hours. Like most things at
      VVR dinner was too expensive. But breakfast was reasonably priced so we chowed down on that before leaving the
      next morning.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 9</h2>
      <p>Instead of braving the ferry ride again we decided to take the Bear Ridge Trail out of VVR back to the JMT.
      This trail was not well maintained and had zero switchbacks despite its steepness which made it a slog to get to
      the top. Because we didn't leave together and there were a number of ways out of VVR John and I didn't see each
      other for most of the day which led John to backtrack at one point looking for me because he thought I was
      lost.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>However, once back on the JMT the switchbacks on the way down to the Bear Creek junction were some of the most
      beautiful I've been on. They went through groves of Aspen and were lined with tons of wildflowers including
      lilies and Alpine Shooting Star. Larz saw a flock of baby quail following its mother across the trail.</p>
      <p>We went swimming on top of a small waterfall after the junction to Break Creek. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We camped with Steph, Larz, Jeff and Dan a little past the Italy Pass Trail junction along the trail next to a
      creek where we went fishing. We caught some small Brook Trout which we released. </p>
      <img src="fishing photo">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 10</h2>
      <p>Marie lake was gorgeous. We took the flower lined trail along side of it as approached Seldon Pass.</p>

    <div>
      <img src="seldon pass">

    <div>
      <p>Epic inifinity pool lake on the other side of the pass with a stream running up to it that was crystal clear
      and full of trout</p>
      <img src="infinity lake">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Stopped at Muir Ranch contemplated leaving with Jeffs friend Dan because my feet were hurting too badly to
      maintain Johns pace but decided to tough it out. Muir Trail Ranch had by far the best hiker buckets but staff was
      rude to backpackers. It would be a nice place to stay however. It's 4 miles from Florence lake. Near hot
      springs. We camped along the river with Jeff and Dan and had a fire. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 11</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We had to take our shoes off to cross the river before entering Evolution Valley. The water was nice and warm
      after meandering its way through the valley all day.</p>
      <p>We would later met a women who was hiking with only one shoe
      and a taped on sandal after she lost her shoe on this crossing by attempting to throw it over the river to her
      husband. She completed the trail and was one of our heroes on the trail.</p>
      <p>At this crossing we also heard of a group of 4 women we had passed earlier. It turns out they all had terminal
      cancer and were doing the trail together. After hearing this inspirational story I decided I had no excuse to not
      finish the trail and was determined to do so despite any pain in my feet. </p>

      <p>Evolution Valley looks directly west making for an incredible sunset that lights up the sky and surrounding
      granite mountains.</p>
      <img src="sunset">
      <p>We camped on a small bluff overlooking Colby Meadow and had a fire.</p>
      <img src="colby meadow campsite">

    <div>
      <h2>Day 12</h2>
      <p>We did the climb up to Evolution Basin early in the morning. The lakes in the basin were full of perfectly
      clear water that reflected the granite mountains that surrounded them spectacularly.</p>
      <img src="evolution basin">

    <div>
      <p>Muir Pass looked like another planet. There's a stone hut at the top that was built by the Sierra Club in
      1930.</p>
      <img src="muir pass climb">
      <img src="muir pass hut">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>On the way down there was enough snow for some sledding on our butts and a snowball fight. There hundreds of
      giant tadpoles in the alpine lakes we passed on our way to camp. This is a good sign because we had been hearing
      the alpine toads are endanged due to overstocking of trout which eat the tadpoles. </p>
      <img src="alpine lake">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We camped a little passed Helen Lake at a campsite on the Middle Fork of the Kings River which had a view of a
      waterfall. </p>
      <img src="middle fork campsite">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 13</h2>
      <p>The morning views from camp of the valley below were spectacular.</p>
      <img src="morning valley">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We stopped at the ranger station to get some extra bars and stuff from some friendly Canadians we had met who
      were leaving out of Bishop pass and were happy to lighten their load.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The valley leading up to the Golden Staircase is full awesome cascading waterfalls which, on this trip, were
      second in grandeur only to those found in Yosemite Valley itself.</p>
      <img src="waterfall">
      <p>Soaked my feet in the creek during lunch. There's nothing more rejuvenating than sticking sore feet in a creek
      full of fresh snow melt.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The Golden Staircase had a lot of false peeks that kept tricking us into thinking we were almost at the top.
      But once arrived we knew it was worth it.</p>
      <img src="valley?">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We camped on top of the Golden Staircase next to Place Lake. The moon came out early and was almost full.</p>
      <img src="placer lake at sunset">
      <img src="placer lake camp">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 14</h2>
      <p>I got up early and made my way to Mather Pass before anyone else was up. The basin on the way to the pass was
      especially beautiful as the mountains reflected perfectly off the still wildflower lined lakes at this early
      hour.</p>
      <img src="placer lake morning">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The other side of the pass was a very high desert that dropped down into a lush valley. The trail had us hike out
      of the valley as soon as we got down into it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We camped ext to Lake Marjorie which is the bluest lake I've ever seen. We had a drum circle with some new
      friends Ross and Emma (aka Ross-ta-far-hike and Purple Haze) we met along the trail. Behind the lake is a huge
      red iron mountain we will pass tomorrow. We heard a rocks slide before bed that lasted for what seemed like
      minutes and echoed off the mountains all around us.</p>
      <img src="lake marjorie">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 15</h2>
      <p>Woke up early and did Pinchot Pass.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Stayed at Rae Lakes caught tons of fish the lake is full of trout. We ate a bunch of them for dinner. I went
      swimming in the lake twice. It was surprisingly warm for fresh snow melt. The mountains here have cool veins
      running through them of iron, granite and what we think might be limestone that gives it this cool red grey and
      white pattern. Full moon tonight. It's the brightest I've ever seen it. It hurts your eyes to look at it its so
      bright. </p>

      <h2>Day 16</h2>
      <p>The views of Rae Lakes as we went up Glen Pass were amazing. These lakes were one of my favorite places on
      this trip and someplace I definitely hope to return to.</p>

    <div>
      <p>We camped up at 11300 feet in a granite bowl before the pass. There was an epic waterfall that spilled out of
      the sheer granite wall into a stream lined with some of the only greenery around. We could hear this waterfall
      roaring through the basin from our campsite miles away which made me feel like we were camping in Mordor.</p>
      <img src="forester campsite">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 17</h2>
      <p>Forester pass is the second highest climb on the trail, second only to Whitney. It certainly feels like a
      strange world at that elevation. The pass itself wasn't as hard as it was built up to be, we had been hearing
      people say it was the hardest pass of the trip.</p>
      <img src="forester pass">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I listend to "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" by Philip K Dick on the way down through what felt like an
      alien world at times. Lots of granite high desert and sparse trees at first until we dove into the forest of
      Sequoia trees.</p>
      <img src="cloud">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>There was a beautiful mesa on the way to Crabtree Meadows with 360 degree views and lots of marmots just
      asking to be photographed.</p>
      <img src="marmot">
      <img src="fallen tree panorama">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We did 16.6 miles total to get to Crabtree Meadows Ranger station which included the climb over Forester Pass.
      Boy was I tired, and my feet were hurting too. This was the first I really noticed some redness and swelling
      spreading through the top of my foot. This redness later turned out to be a Staph infection I must have gotten
      from one of he many blisters I had had up to this point in the trip.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 18</h2>
      <p>We had heard many people wanting to get up to Mt Whitney for sunrise but we decided to buck the trend and do
      sunset instead. Which meant we could get a late start and do a late lunch at Guitar Lake while we waited for the
      heat of the day to die down.</p>
      <img src="guitar lake">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>By this point in the trip my muscles had had so much conditioning that the climb up to Mt Whitney was
      physically a peace of cake. However the infection in my feet made a wrongly placed step extremely painful.</p>
      <img src="up to whitney">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Our decision to watch sunset turned out to be a good one. We had the whole summit to ourselves to watch the
      most spectacular 360 degree sunset I have ever seen. We left most of our gear at the cutoff for the climb up but
      we bought the Jet Boil so we were able to make tea at the top which was as it started getting cold as the sun
      went down.</p>
      <img src="whitney summit 1">
      <img src="whitney summit 2">
      <p>We left before it was completely dark but still much of our hike down was using headlamps. This wasn't too bad
      and we actually passed a number of people on their way up for sunrise the next day. As an aside someone we talked
      to later said sunrise was so crowded that people were stepping on his sleeping bag while he was trying to sleep
      because space was so limited. We camped just on the other side of the pass as we came down switchbacks that were
      covered in water.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Day 19</h2>
      <p>We didn't get much sleep because we had to sleep so close to the trail and there was a steady stream of people
      passing us to go up the mountain.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Coming down was extremely painful because my foot was totally red and swollen at this point.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The last few miles were hot and had very little water, this was probably the driest section of the whole
      trip.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We past many day hikers going up to Whitney or Lone Pine Lake. However coming up from Whitney Portal to one of
      those destinations in the heat of the day seemed extremely difficult as there was little relief from the constant
      elevation gain.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>At Whitney Portal Steph got a pancake that was the size of a pizza.</p>
