Doing things and telling people about them; expanding my luck surface area.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


I've always been pretty good at doing things but pretty terrible at telling
people about them. For example, I've recorded and released multiple albums, but some of my
friends wouldn't even know it. For whatever reason I grew up with this idea of
"self promotion" being "shameful" so this blog is my attempt to dispel that
notion. This is all in an attempt to
[increase my luck surface
area](http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area),
that is 
>The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck
>Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something
>you're passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is
>effectively communicated.

In addition I love learning, it's one of my great passions in life, and as I
learn new things I really want to be able to share them with others.  Not only
does explaining something convince me that I know that I know the subject
matter, but receiving insight from others is a great way to get to greater
depths of understanding.

More specifically you can expect this blog to contain things like "life-hacks",
coverage of projects I'm working on and completed, analysis and how-to's of
music I've made, short tutorials on web development, gadget reviews, programming
tips and tricks, reviews of books and articles I've read (mostly tech related),
new bands and albums I like and why, pictures and reviews of trails I've hiked
or places I've traveled or shows I've gone too, and ideas I have that I think
are worth sharing.

I want to do my best to avoid having this be a spot for meandering ramblings and
stick to the point of conveying what I want to say as acurately and concise as
possible.  My mantra will be the same mantra I learned when I first started
writing code: *Keep It Simple Stupid*.

Last but not least I think writing a blog will be fun. I know I'm not the
greatest writer but I hope you'll bare with me as work my way through
transferring my brain waves to electronic pros.

So with that I'll end my first post. Thank you for your interest, please follow
