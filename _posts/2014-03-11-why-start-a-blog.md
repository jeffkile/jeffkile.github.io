Do things and telling people about them; expanding your "Luck Surface Area".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


I've always been pretty good at [doing](/portfolio) [things](/music) but pretty terrible at telling
people about them. The pervasive notion that one should avoid ["shameless self promotion"](http://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/why-you-should-be-a-shameless-self-promoter.html) has prevented me from sharing as much as I should. 
This blog is an attempt
increase my ["luck surface
area"](http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area),
that is 
>The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck
>Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something
>you're passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is
>effectively communicated.

More specifically you can expect this blog to contain things like “life-hacks”, short programming tutorials, tips and tricks, gadget reviews, coverage of my projects both in progress and completed, commentary on new albums I like as well as my own compositions, and anything else I think is worth sharing.

Writing a blog will be fun. I love learning, it’s one of my greatest passions in life, and as I learn new things I really want to be able to share them. Receiving insight from others is a great way to build higher understanding, so I encourage you to make these entries into conversations.

I hope you’ll bare with me as I work my way through transferring my brain waves to electronic prose. I will do my best to keep this blog as concise as possible; my mantra will be the same mantra I learned when I first started writing code: “Keep It Simple, Stupid.”
