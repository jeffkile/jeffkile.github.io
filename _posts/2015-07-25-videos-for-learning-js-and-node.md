# JS WAT

This is a great first video to watch because its both funny and gives you an insight into why so
many people get tripped up on Javascript once they start seriously programming in it.

The thing with Javascript is that it looks a lot like other languages, namely Java, and so lots of
people who have experience with other languages think they know more about it than they do. Things
like scoping, objects and functions are examples of things that have very different behavior than
in Java but look very similar and so many people incorrectly assume they work in a certain way.

The typing system is another example of a JS language feature that works very differently than one
might naively expect, which this video does a great job highlighting.

The answers to why this behavior occurs can be found over on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9032856/what-is-the-explanation-for-these-bizarre-javascript-behaviours-mentioned-in-the)


# Ryan Dahl's original Node.js presentation

This is where it all started. If you're going to be writing Node.js you should watch this video
before you do anything else.

Ryan's thesis that traditional web frameworks do I/O wrong is the core concept behind why people
use Node.js. It is essential you understand the Ah-Hah moment this represented to the web
development community back in 2009.
